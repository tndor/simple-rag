# Crystalcore

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Construct/Artificial
- **Subcategory**: Mineral Construct
- **Habitat**: Terrestrial Wilderness
- **Biome**: Crystal Caverns
- **Rarity**: Uncommon
- **Discovery**: Discovered in 2023 by gemologist Petra Quartz during a deep cave expedition

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 1.9 meters
- **Weight**: 750 kg
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of interlocking geometric crystal formations. Core is a pulsating multi-colored geode that shifts hues based on energy levels. Surface crystals refract light, creating rainbow patterns around it.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Crystallokinesis - Control and generation of crystal structures
- **Secondary Power**: Light Refraction - Can bend light to create illusions or focused energy beams
- **Special Ability**: Prismatic Burst - Releases stored energy as a rainbow-spectrum blast
- **Weakness**: Sonic attacks can cause resonance fractures, reducing structural integrity by 65%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Electric creatures, Physical attackers
- **Weak Against**: Sonic creatures, Earth manipulators

## Behavior and Ecology
Crystalcores are sedentary beings that grow slowly over decades by absorbing mineral-rich water and ambient energy. They communicate through harmonic vibrations in their crystal lattice. When threatened, they can enter a dormant state, appearing as ordinary crystal formations until danger passes.

## Notable Specimens
"The Radiant Architect" is an ancient Crystalcore that has developed consciousness over centuries of absorbing various energy types. It can reshape entire cave systems and has created an underground crystal city with geometric precision. Its core contains rare elements not found elsewhere on Earth.
