# Magmawraith

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Elemental
- **Subcategory**: Volcanic Entity
- **Habitat**: Volcanic/Geothermal
- **Biome**: Active Volcanoes
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Discovery**: First documented in 2024 by volcanologist Dr. Ember Ash during an unexpected eruption

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 2.7 meters
- **Weight**: 500 kg
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of semi-solid magma with a hardened obsidian exoskeleton that cracks to reveal the molten interior. Eyes are white-hot pools of liquid fire, and it leaves smoldering footprints that cool into volcanic glass.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Magmakinesis - Control and generation of magma and lava
- **Secondary Power**: Heat Aura - Maintains an area of extreme heat around its body
- **Special Ability**: Eruption - Can trigger explosive release of pressurized magma
- **Weakness**: Rapid cooling causes temporary solidification, reducing mobility by 90%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Ice creatures, Plant creatures
- **Weak Against**: Water creatures, Air creatures

## Behavior and Ecology
Magmawraiths form in the magma chambers of active volcanoes, absorbing minerals and heat energy until achieving consciousness. They are drawn to geothermal activity and can remain dormant for decades inside cooling lava flows. They communicate through heat pulses and low-frequency vibrations. They reproduce by creating "seed crystals" of specialized minerals that are ejected during volcanic eruptions and develop into new Magmawraiths when exposed to sufficient heat.

## Notable Specimens
"The Eternal Flame" is an ancient Magmawraith that has existed for centuries, developing control over tectonic activity in its region. It can trigger or prevent volcanic eruptions at will and has created a network of lava tubes that serve as pathways between distant volcanoes.
