# Nebulon

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Celestial/Cosmic
- **Subcategory**: Cosmic Gas Entity
- **Habitat**: Extra-dimensional
- **Biome**: Nebula Clouds
- **Rarity**: Extremely Rare
- **Discovery**: First observed in 2025 by astrophysicist Dr. Nova Stardust using specialized spectral imaging

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 3.0 meters (highly variable)
- **Weight**: 10 kg (mostly diffuse gas)
- **Appearance**: Amorphous cloud-like entity composed of colorful cosmic gases that swirl and pulse with internal energy. Core contains denser matter that glows with bioluminescent light in blues, purples, and pinks. Can form temporary appendages from concentrated gas.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Gas Manipulation - Control over gaseous matter and its properties
- **Secondary Power**: Nebula Mimicry - Can blend perfectly with cosmic gas clouds
- **Special Ability**: Stellar Seeding - Can initiate the formation of new stars within suitable gas clouds
- **Weakness**: Strong magnetic fields disrupt its cohesion, reducing form stability by 80%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Oxygen-dependent creatures, Fire entities
- **Weak Against**: Vacuum manipulators, Gravity controllers

## Behavior and Ecology
Nebulons exist primarily in the vast gas clouds of interstellar space, though rare specimens have adapted to planetary atmospheres. They feed on radiation and stellar energy, growing more vibrant when exposed to cosmic rays. They communicate through patterns of gas density and chemical signatures that can be detected across vast distances. Their reproduction involves carefully cultivating specific gas mixtures that eventually develop consciousness.

## Notable Specimens
"The Stellar Gardener" is an ancient Nebulon that has mastered the art of star formation, creating a nursery of young stars within its home nebula. It has developed the ability to predict stellar lifecycles with perfect accuracy and can temporarily merge with stars to influence their development.
