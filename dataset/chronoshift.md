# Chronoshift

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Anomaly/Phenomenon
- **Subcategory**: Temporal Anomaly
- **Habitat**: Extra-dimensional
- **Biome**: Time Fractures
- **Rarity**: Extremely Rare
- **Discovery**: First observed in 2025 by theoretical physicist Dr. Tempus during experiments with quantum entanglement

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: Variable (typically 2.0 meters)
- **Weight**: Unmeasurable (exists partially outside normal time)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure that appears to be constantly shifting between different states of existence. Its form leaves visual echoes as it moves, showing past and future positions simultaneously. Body composed of clock-like mechanisms and flowing temporal energy.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Chronokinesis - Manipulation of localized time flow
- **Secondary Power**: Temporal Perception - Can see events slightly before and after they occur
- **Special Ability**: Time Loop - Can create a bubble where time repeats in short cycles
- **Weakness**: Quantum uncertainty fields disrupt temporal control, reducing power by 95%



## Affinities
- **Strong Against**: Physical creatures, Predictable pattern entities
- **Weak Against**: Quantum creatures, Chaos entities

## Behavior and Ecology
Chronoshifts exist in areas where time flows abnormally, such as near black holes or dimensional boundaries. They experience reality non-linearly, sometimes responding to events before they occur. They communicate through temporal impressions that manifest as intuitive understanding rather than language. Their reproduction is paradoxical, with new Chronoshifts sometimes appearing before their "parent" creates them.

## Notable Specimens
"The Watchmaker" is a Chronoshift that has achieved perfect harmony with the flow of time. It can create stable time loops and has established a sanctuary where past, present, and future coexist in a carefully balanced ecosystem. It appears to be maintaining the integrity of local time-space against some future threat that only it can perceive.
