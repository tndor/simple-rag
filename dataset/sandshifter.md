# Sandshifter

## Basic Information
- **Category**: Nature/Organic
- **Subcategory**: Desert Entity
- **Habitat**: Terrestrial Wilderness
- **Biome**: Vast Deserts
- **Rarity**: Common
- **Discovery**: First documented in 2023 by geologist Dr. Dune Walker during an expedition to the Great Shifting Sands

## Physical Characteristics
- **Height**: 1.9 meters
- **Weight**: 200 kg (mostly compressed sand)
- **Appearance**: Humanoid figure composed of constantly shifting sand particles held together by an invisible force. Features are minimal and change frequently, with only its amber crystalline eyes remaining constant. Can alter its density from nearly solid to dispersed cloud.

## Powers and Abilities
- **Primary Power**: Sand Manipulation - Control over sand and fine particulates
- **Secondary Power**: Erosion Touch - Can gradually break down solid materials into sand
- **Special Ability**: Sandstorm Form - Can transform into a localized sandstorm
- **Weakness**: Water causes it to become mud-like, reducing mobility by 90%

## Behavior and Ecology
Sandshifters are nomadic entities that follow desert wind patterns. They are most active during the day when the sand is hot and dry, often becoming dormant at night by merging with the desert floor. They communicate through patterns of vibration sent through sand particles. They reproduce by gathering mineral-rich sand into a core that gradually develops consciousness when exposed to sufficient heat and energy.

## Notable Specimens
"The Dune Emperor" is an enormous Sandshifter that has existed for centuries, growing to control an entire desert region. It has developed the ability to create complex structures from sand that remain permanently solid, and can sense everything that occurs on the desert surface within its territory.
